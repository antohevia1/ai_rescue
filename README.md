# Keras Faster R-CNN for Object Detection

This is an implementation of [Faster R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497) on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. The model generates bounding boxes for each instance of an object in the image. It's based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a VGG16 backbone.
